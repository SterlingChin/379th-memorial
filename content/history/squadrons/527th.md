# 527th Bombardment Squadron

The 527th Bombardment Squadron was one of the four original squadrons of the 379th Bombardment Group, identified by the squadron code **FO** painted on their aircraft.

## Activation and Training

The 527th was activated on November 26, 1942, at Gowen Field, Boise, Idaho, as part of the 379th Bombardment Group. Like its sister squadrons, the 527th trained with B-17 Flying Fortresses at Wendover Field, Utah and Sioux City AAF, Iowa before deploying overseas.

## Deployment to England

The ground unit moved for final processing at Camp Douglas, Wisconsin, then to Camp Shanks, New York. They sailed on the RMS Aquitania on May 10, 1943, arriving at Clyde, Scotland on May 18, 1943.

The aircraft left Sioux City, Iowa on April 9, 1943, flying to Bangor, Maine via Kearney, Nebraska and Selfridge, Michigan. They commenced overseas movement on April 15, 1943, via the North Atlantic ferry route.

By late May 1943, both air and ground echelons had assembled at RAF Kimbolton, ready for combat operations.

## Combat Operations

The 527th flew its first combat mission on May 29, 1943, joining the other squadrons in the attack on German U-boat pens at St. Nazaire, France. Over the next two years, the squadron participated in the full range of 8th Air Force operations:

- **Strategic Bombing Campaign** - Attacking German industrial capacity, including aircraft factories, ball bearing plants, and synthetic oil refineries
- **Transportation Targets** - Rail marshalling yards, bridges, and communication centers
- **Close Air Support** - Direct support of ground forces during the Normandy invasion and subsequent campaigns
- **Interdiction Missions** - Disrupting German supply lines and reinforcements

## The Birmingham Jewell Connection

While assigned to a different squadron, the famous B-17G "Birmingham Jewell" was closely associated with the 379th Bomb Group. Another notable aircraft that served with the group was "Queenie" (B-17G 42-102627), which flew missions with both the 91st and 379th Bomb Groups, including service with the 527th.

## Distinguished Service

The 527th Bombardment Squadron received two Distinguished Unit Citations as part of the 379th Bomb Group:

1. For sustained combat operations demonstrating exceptional performance from May 1943 through July 1944
2. As part of the 1st Bomb Division's January 11, 1944 mission to Oschersleben, when bombers flew without fighter escort to attack critical aircraft factories

## Contributing to the Grand Slam

In April 1944, the 527th played its part in helping the 379th Bomb Group achieve the unprecedented "8th Air Force Operational Grand Slam"—finishing first in all five operational categories:

1. Best bombing accuracy
2. Greatest tonnage dropped
3. Largest number of aircraft attacking
4. Lowest aircraft losses
5. Lowest abort rate

This achievement remains unique in 8th Air Force history.

## Deactivation

Following V-E Day, the 527th joined the effort to transport American troops back to the United States. The squadron was inactivated on July 25, 1945, at Casablanca, Morocco, after two years, seven months, and 29 days of active service.
