# 524th Bombardment Squadron

The 524th Bombardment Squadron was one of the four original squadrons of the 379th Bombardment Group, identified by the squadron code **WA** painted on their aircraft.

## Activation and Training

The 524th was activated on November 26, 1942, at Gowen Field, Boise, Idaho, as part of the 379th Bombardment Group. After initial organization, the squadron moved to Wendover Field, Utah to begin training as a heavy bomber unit with the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.

Training continued at Sioux City AAF, Iowa from February 1943 until the squadron's departure for overseas movement in April 1943.

## Combat Operations

The air echelon arrived at RAF Bovingdon by late April 1943, then joined the ground echelon at RAF Kimbolton on May 20, 1943. Kimbolton (AAF Station 117) would be the squadron's home for the remainder of the war.

The 524th flew its first combat mission on May 29, 1943, attacking German U-boat pens at St. Nazaire, France. Over the next two years, the squadron participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Nazi Germany, targeting:

- Industrial facilities and factories
- Rail marshalling yards
- Oil refineries and storage facilities
- Aircraft assembly plants
- V-weapon launch sites (Operation Crossbow)
- Tactical support for D-Day and ground operations

## Notable Aircraft: Ol' Gappy

The 524th Squadron was home to **Ol' Gappy**, a B-17G that flew **157 combat missions**—more than any other heavy bomber in the entire 8th Air Force. This remarkable aircraft became a symbol of the durability and reliability of both the B-17 and the ground crews who maintained it.

The aircraft earned its nickname from battle damage sustained early in its career that was never fully repaired, leaving a distinctive "gap" in its appearance.

## Distinguished Service

The 524th Bombardment Squadron received two Distinguished Unit Citations as part of the 379th Bomb Group:

1. For sustained combat operations from May 28, 1943 through July 31, 1944
2. As part of the 1st Bomb Division for the mission to Oschersleben on January 11, 1944, when the bombers flew without fighter protection to attack aircraft factories

## Squadron Personnel

Notable veterans of the 524th include:

- **Lt. Col. John Carl Taylor** - Pilot and Commander who rose through the ranks while serving with the squadron. His service extended beyond WWII to include deployments to the Pacific and Laos.

## Deactivation

Following V-E Day, the 524th participated in transporting military personnel back to the United States via Morocco. The squadron was inactivated on July 25, 1945, at Casablanca, Morocco.
