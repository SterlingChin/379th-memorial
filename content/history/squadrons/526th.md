# 526th Bombardment Squadron

The 526th Bombardment Squadron was one of the four original squadrons of the 379th Bombardment Group, identified by the squadron code **LF** painted on their aircraft.

## Activation and Training

The 526th was first activated at Geiger Field, Washington in November 1942 as one of the four original squadrons of the 379th Bombardment Group. After initial organization, a cadre moved to Wendover Field, Utah to begin training as a heavy bomber unit with the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.

The squadron continued training at Sioux City AAF, Iowa until departure for overseas movement in April 1943.

## Combat in the European Theater

The air echelon of the squadron arrived at RAF Bovingdon by April 24, 1943, and remained there until May 20, when it joined the ground echelon at RAF Kimbolton. Kimbolton would be the squadron's combat station for the remainder of its time in the European Theater of Operations.

The squadron flew its first combat mission on May 29, 1943, and focused on the strategic bombing campaign against Germany. Key operations included:

- **Strategic Bombing** - Attacks on industrial targets, rail infrastructure, and military installations throughout Nazi-occupied Europe
- **Operation Crossbow** - Attacks on V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket launch sites threatening England
- **D-Day Support** - On June 6, 1944, the squadron bombed defended positions just ahead of the Allied landings
- **Normandy Campaign** - Struck airfields, rail choke points, and gun emplacements during the campaign to liberate France

## Distinguished Service

The 526th Bombardment Squadron was twice awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for its combat actions:

1. For sustained operations from May 28, 1943 through July 31, 1944
2. As part of the 1st Bomb Division for the January 11, 1944 mission to Oschersleben

## Squadron Personnel

Notable veterans of the 526th include:

- **1st Lt. Armand Joseph Volpini** - Lead Bombardier who completed 30 missions. Born to Italian immigrants in Massachusetts, Volpini trained as an Aviation Cadet before deploying to England. His oral history, military papers, and interview transcript are preserved in the Library of Congress Veterans History Project.

- **T/Sgt. Elmo Fama** - Served as both Waist Gunner and Radio Operator on a B-17 during the Air Offensive Europe campaign. His oral history was recorded by the Pacific Coast Air Museum in 2017.

## Post-War Service

Following V-E Day, the squadron moved to Morocco, where it participated in the transportation of military personnel back to the United States until it was inactivated in July 1945.

The 526th was later reactivated in November 1955 at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, assigned to the 379th Bombardment Wing under Strategic Air Command. The unit operated Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers and participated in overseas alert operations at Sidi Slimane Air Base, Morocco.
