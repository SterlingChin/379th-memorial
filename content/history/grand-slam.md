# The Grand Slam

In May 1944, it was announced that the 379th Bomb Group had achieved an unprecedented "8th Air Force Operational Grand Slam" during the preceding month. This meant that during April 1944, the 379th was **first in every phase of bombing** in which Bomb Groups of the 8th Air Force were graded.

The 379th Bomb Group remains the only unit ever awarded the 8th Air Force Grand Slam — a distinction that has never been matched.

## The Five Categories

The 8th Air Force evaluated its bomb groups across five operational categories. In April 1944, the 379th finished first in all of them:

### 1. Best Bombing Results
The 379th achieved the greatest percentage of bombs on target of any bomb group in the 8th Air Force. Precision bombing was essential to the strategic bombing campaign, and the 379th's bombardiers and lead crews demonstrated exceptional skill in delivering their ordnance accurately.

### 2. Greatest Tonnage of Bombs Dropped
The 379th delivered more bomb tonnage on enemy targets than any other group during April 1944. By the end of the war, the 379th would drop 26,459 tons of bombs — more than any other heavy bomb group in the 8th Air Force.

### 3. Largest Number of Aircraft Attacking
The 379th put more aircraft over targets than any other group. This required exceptional maintenance, crew readiness, and operational planning to ensure maximum participation in each mission.

### 4. Lowest Losses of Aircraft
Despite putting the most aircraft over targets, the 379th suffered the lowest combat losses of any group. This remarkable achievement reflected superior formation flying, defensive gunnery, and tactical discipline.

### 5. Lowest Abortive Rate
The 379th had the lowest abort rate of aircraft dispatched. When a 379th bomber took off for a mission, it was more likely to reach the target than aircraft from any other group. This was a testament to the ground crews' maintenance excellence and the aircrews' determination.

## Why It Mattered

Achieving first place in one or two categories was noteworthy. Finishing first in all five simultaneously was considered impossible — until the 379th did it.

The Grand Slam demonstrated that the 379th had achieved excellence across every dimension of heavy bomber operations:

- **Accuracy** required skilled bombardiers and precise navigation
- **Tonnage** demanded reliable aircraft and high sortie rates
- **Participation** needed superb maintenance and crew availability
- **Low losses** reflected tactical excellence and crew coordination
- **Low aborts** proved mechanical reliability and aircrew determination

No other bomb group in the history of the 8th Air Force ever replicated this achievement.

## The Men Behind the Achievement

The Grand Slam was not the work of any single individual but the collective achievement of approximately 6,000 personnel assigned to RAF Kimbolton (Station 117):

- **Aircrews** who flew into hostile skies over occupied Europe
- **Ground crews** who kept the B-17s flying in all conditions
- **Armorers** who loaded thousands of bombs
- **Intelligence officers** who planned and briefed each mission
- **Medical personnel** who cared for the wounded
- **Support staff** who kept the base operational

### Commanding Officers

- **Colonel Maurice A. Preston** — Original commanding officer who led the 379th from activation through October 10, 1944
- **Colonel Lewis E. Lyle** — Assumed command on October 10, 1944, having previously flown 69 combat missions in a B-17

## The 379th's Overall Combat Record

The Grand Slam was the crowning achievement of a bomb group that compiled the most successful combat record of all Eighth Air Force heavy bomber groups:

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Combat Missions | 330 |
| Bombs Dropped | 26,459 tons |
| Enemy Aircraft Destroyed | 315 |
| B-17s Lost to Enemy Action | 141 |
| First Mission | May 29, 1943 |
| Last Mission | April 25, 1945 |

The 379th flew its first 300 missions in less time than any other heavy bombardment group. The group received two Presidential Unit Citations for its accomplishments in combat.

## Notable Aircraft

The 379th's maintenance excellence was exemplified by aircraft that achieved remarkable mission counts:

- **"Ole Gappy"** — Completed 157 missions with only one abort, possibly the highest mission count of any 8th Air Force bomber
- **"Swamp Fire"** (B-17G #42-32024) — Flew 100 missions without a single abort, an almost unheard-of accomplishment

## Legacy

The nickname "The Grand Slam Group" became synonymous with the 379th Bomb Group and remains their legacy to this day. The Triangle K symbol — the 379th's tail marking — is still honored at the former RAF Kimbolton site, where the Hunts Kart Racing club uses it as their flag.
