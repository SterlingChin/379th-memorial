# Kimbolton Airfield

RAF Kimbolton, designated AAF Station 117, served as the home of the 379th Bomb Group from May 1943 until the group's departure in July 1945. Located in Cambridgeshire, England, the airfield became one of the most operationally successful bomber bases in the 8th Air Force.

## Origins

Like many B-17 bases in England, the airfield at Kimbolton was originally constructed as a fighter base for the Royal Air Force. When it became evident that Germany was not going to invade England, the RAF determined it no longer needed many of its inland fighter bases.

The British were happy to lease most of these airfields to the United States for use as bases for heavy bombers. However, the runways and perimeter ramps were too thin to accommodate the weight of B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators, so the United States paid the British to repair and replace the runways to meet the necessary specifications for heavy bomber operations.

## The Four Squadrons

The 379th Bomb Group consisted of four bombardment squadrons, all based at Kimbolton:

- **524th Bombardment Squadron**
- **525th Bombardment Squadron**
- **526th Bombardment Squadron**
- **527th Bombardment Squadron**

Each squadron maintained its own aircraft, crews, and ground personnel while operating under the unified command of the 379th Bomb Group.

## Life at Kimbolton

Approximately 6,000 personnel were assigned to Kimbolton airfield during the war, comprising 72 different military occupations. The base was a self-contained community that included:

- **Flight operations** — Pilots, co-pilots, navigators, bombardiers, and gunners
- **Maintenance** — Ground crews who kept the B-17s flying in all conditions
- **Ordnance** — Armorers who loaded bombs and maintained defensive weapons
- **Intelligence** — Officers who planned missions and briefed crews
- **Medical** — Personnel who cared for wounded airmen
- **Support services** — Administration, food service, transportation, and communications

The men lived in Nissen huts dispersed around the airfield perimeter. Despite the constant stress of combat operations, they found ways to maintain morale through sports, entertainment, and visits to nearby towns.

## Relations with Local Community

The 379th developed strong ties with the people of Kimbolton village and the surrounding area. Local families often hosted American servicemen, and many lasting friendships were formed. Mrs. Peggy Convine's family farm was located on the land where the airbase was built, and she maintained connections with 379th veterans for decades after the war.

These relationships are commemorated today through memorials in both the United States and England, including the gathering of soil from Kimbolton for the Heritage Monument dedication.

## The Triangle K

All B-17s of the 379th Bomb Group carried distinctive markings that identified them in formation. As part of the 1st Bombardment Division, each aircraft displayed a large triangle on the vertical stabilizer. Within this triangle was painted the letter "K" — the 379th's assigned code.

This marking became so iconic that the 379th became known as the **Triangle K Group**. The symbol remains associated with the 379th to this day, and is still displayed at the former RAF Kimbolton site.

## Operational Record from Kimbolton

Flying from Station 117, the 379th compiled the most successful combat record of any heavy bomb group in the 8th Air Force:

- **330 combat missions** flown from Kimbolton
- **26,459 tons of bombs** dropped on enemy targets
- **315 enemy aircraft** destroyed
- **141 B-17s** lost to enemy action
- **Two Presidential Unit Citations** awarded

The 379th flew its first 300 missions in less time than any other heavy bombardment group. In April 1944, operating from Kimbolton, the group achieved the unprecedented "Grand Slam" — finishing first in all five operational categories by which 8th Air Force bomb groups were evaluated.

## After the War

The 379th Bomb Group was deactivated on July 25, 1945, at Casablanca, Morocco. The airfield at Kimbolton returned to agricultural use, though traces of the wartime base remained visible for many years.

Today, portions of the former airfield are used by the Hunts Kart Racing Club, which honors the 379th's legacy by displaying the Triangle K symbol as their flag. Several memorials in Kimbolton village commemorate the American airmen who served there.

## Memorials at Kimbolton

The 379th Bomb Group is remembered at several locations in and around Kimbolton:

1. **Kimbolton Airfield Monument** — Located at the former airfield site
2. **Kimbolton Plaque** — In the village center
3. **St. Andrews Church** — The village church where soil was gathered for the Heritage Monument dedication in the United States
