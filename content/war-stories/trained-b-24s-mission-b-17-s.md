TRAINED B-24S - MISSION B-17'S

Pilot, 379th BG, 524th Squadron

Yes, the end-result is that our crew completed 33 
missions in the B-17 with the magnificent 379th Bomb 
Group but it did not start out that way. So what is new 
about the army's way of doing things?

We did, in 
fact, train as a B-24 crew which came together at 
Westover Field, Ma. in late Sept, 1944 and immediately 
banded together as a family. We were ten young men, all 
from different states; TX, PA, LA, KY, MT, MN, MA, IL, 
NY, and OK, destined to spend an unknown period of time 
with each other in situations where our very lives would 
depend upon each other.

Our overseas training was 
at Chatham Field (now Savannah municipal airport) in 
Savannah GA. We knew we were ultimately heading into 
combat overseas but knew not where. Our bombardier, Tom 
Shively did not accompany us overseas. Mass pattern 
bombing had become the desired method and a bombardier 
was not needed on every plane. Tom remained stateside to 
train other bombardiers and was the only one of our crew 
that followed a military career. He never had the 
privilege of flying with the 379th!! From Savannah we 
reported to Mitchell Field, NY to await further 
assignment. After one week of weather delays at 
Mitchell, we finally got our orders. England it would 
be, with stops at Bangor Maine, Goose Bay, Labrador, 
Reykjavik, Iceland and the final destination at Valley 
Wales. Then on to the replacement center at Stone 
England on Nov. 22 1944.

I suppose all crews went 
through Stone England, both entering and leaving 
England. It was a period of extreme anxiety when 
entering and extreme excitement when leaving. Our entire 
group of 30 plus B-24 crews were suddenly mixed with air 
crews of all descriptions. Those entering, with no idea 
as to what to expect and those leaving, having completed 
their required tour and probably thinking, "you innocent 
devils, I survived my tour, now it's your turn." Those 6 
days spent at Stone were extremely enjoyable, as well as 
educational. It was truly our first experience with an 
"Airman's Melting pot".

On Nov. 28, 1944, we left 
Stone to report to our newly assigned base, the 379th 
Heavy Bomb Group, located at Kimbolton England. The 
short trip was by rail and upon alighting from the 
compartment in our rail car this B-24 crew observed 
NOTHING but B-17s in all directions. In astonishment, we 
immediately looked at each other and said, "What the 
hell are we doing here!" We double-checked our written 
orders and we were at the correct destination. We 
immediately reported to the officer in charge, presented 
him with our official transfer papers, watched him go 
over them, then turn to us with eyes as big as saucers 
and exclaim, "What the hell are you guys doing here-you 
are a B-24 crew - this is a B-17 outfit”. Our instant 
reply was, "sir, that's what we would like to know. We 
too are dumbfounded!" His reply was, "0K, I'll put you 
up for the night and call Pinetree (code name for 
headquarters in London) to see what the hell I'm 
supposed to do with you and will see you here tomorrow 
morning at 09:00." Confused?, scared?, excited?, full of 
anticipation? YES, all of the above!! Here we were, 
finally ready for combat after hundreds of hours in 
training, and the authorities don't even know what to do 
with us!!!!! Good grief, what now??

09:00 AM, 
following morning, we report to the officer in charge 
who reports to us, "Pinetree advises me that I am 
supposed to keep you, train you, and use you as a B-17 
combat crew, which we need more than the B-24 groups do. 
They tell me you are " quite adaptable and we can train 
you readily." (We were one of five crews assigned to the 
379th that particular day but I think that we were the 
only B-24 crew involved.) In the mighty 8th Air Force 
the 1st and 3rd divisions were B-17s and the 2nd 
division was B-24s - hence-twice as many B-17 crews were 
needed as compared to B-24 crews. We wondered at the 
time: "Do they really mean "ADAPTABLE or EXPENDABLE.” We 
later found that it was a genuine compliment that they 
considered our crew capable of being readily adaptable 
to unusual situations as needed.

After 
approximately 6 hours training as co-pilot while 
slow-timing newly installed engines and 2 missions as 
co-pilot, all with pilot Garner Brown, (Re: Group 
mission # 248 and 252) I was pronounced ready to go as 
first pilot. The rest of the crew also received a very 
short indoctrination in the B-17 and was pronounced as 
ready. As shocking and traumatic as it was at the time, 
we all later admitted that it was a good transfer. We 
successfully completed 33 missions and returned home in 
one piece.

The B-17 is a more "forgiving" 
aircraft and is truly capable of "coming in on a wing 
and a prayer" when the B-24 could not have done so! 
However, I am most grateful to have had the unusual 
privilege of piloting BOTH of these fine bombers.
