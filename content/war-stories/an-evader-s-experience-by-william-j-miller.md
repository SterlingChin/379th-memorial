AN EVADER'S EXPERIENCE by William J. Miller

William J. Miller’s story was published in the 379th 
Bomb Group WWII Association’s magazine/newsletter 
‘CONTRAILS’ in August 1992. Mr. Miller is now deceased.

September 16, 1943. It was mission number thirty for 
the 379th Bombardment Group (Heavy). The 
target was a ball bearing plant, Nantes, France. The 
379th flew as high Group in the formation of 
the 41st Bomb Wing. The Triangle K Group 
scheduled nineteen planes. One aborted due to 
mechanical failure. Total bomb load was 164 X 500 
pounders. Leading the Troup was aircraft commander and 
pilot Lt. Col. Robert S. Kittel; navigator, Capt. James 
Edwards; bombardier, Capt. Joseph G. Glaser.

In 
the formation was B-17 No. 42-29876, “Battlin’ Bobbie”, 
piloted by 1st Lt. Elton “Pete” Hoyt. Aboard 
with nine others of the crew was Technical Sergeant 
William J. Miller, left waist gunner. Bill’s story of 
his twenty-third mission unfolds below.

Flying 
at 25,000 feet, “Battlin’ Bobbie” was under fighter 
attack from above and both sides while flying through 
heavy flak. A shell went through the gas tank in the 
left wing and it caught fire. “When an inferno fueled 
by one hundred octane gasoline is in front of you, there 
are no heroes around. You need no one to push you out 
of the plane. It’s all voluntary as fast as you can – 
out you go!” Bill said.

“I 
dropped down and down in errie silence until at 5000 
feet I pulled the rip cord. The chute didn’t open. 
When it didn’t ‘blossom’, I muttered, ‘Well, it’s no use 
to depend on the Army!’ and threw up my hands in 
disgust. The flap opened and out came the chute. One 
hand had been on the flap.” He landed in an apple 
orchard and immediately was surrounded by Frenchmen. 
They gathered up his chute and took off through the 
orchard heading north. By this time he had his map and 
compass handy and he started south. Scared stiff, with 
a “Boy Scout” knife held tightly in his hand, he was 
ready for anything.

It was 
just a few minutes after he started to walk down a 
country road that he passed a young man about twenty 
years old who was sitting on a fence rail. He watched 
Bill go by, then jumped down and started to walk 
alongside of him.

“You 
are an American?” the young man asked in French.

“Yes.” Bill replied in French learned years ago in high 
school.

“The 
Germans are looking for you.” the young man remarked.

“I 
know.” Bill replied.

“Follow me,” the young man said.

Bill 
went with him for about a mile through the brush and 
trees to a swampy willow patch. They stopped and the 
young man advised, “Wait here on this log and I will 
return when it’s getting dark-about seven o’clock.” It 
was then about three. “When I return I’ll be singing La 
Marseillaise.” What luck! Bill had made contact with 
the French Underground.

That 
night Bill met up with Lt Hoyt and Staff Sgt. Herbert J. 
Dulberg, radio operator-gunner of his crew. They 
compared notes and agreed that everyone had gotten out 
of the plane. Bill was the last one to jump from the 
rear and Lt. Hoyt was the last one out of the front.

The 
next day they met Sgt. Edward R. Shaffer, tail gunner of 
the crew. And Staff Sgt. Cyril G. Koval, right waist 
gunner on a plane from the 526th Squadron 
that was shot down, joined them, too. They were picked 
up in the center of the town of Redon by a chartered bus 
run by The Underground. Staff Sgt. Harry L. Minor, 
right waist gunner of the crew, was already on it. They 
were taken to the home of Rene’ Pansart located on the 
edge of the town of St. Malo. With their arrival, nine 
Americans were now there in hiding. One was there since 
September 9th.

While 
hiding at Pansart’s, they were joined by another 
American. For some reason the canny French didn’t feel 
comfortable with this American even though he spoke good 
English. All of the fellows had conversations with 
him. John Bielstein, one of them, asked what kind of a 
plane he flew in. He said it was a Thunderbolt. John 
asked what happened to the rest of his crew. He replied 
they bailed out when they first got hit. They knew then 
something was fishy. From then on he was carefully 
watched.

That 
night when he was undressing for bed, he dropped a 
shoe. The heel came off and a paper fell from it. 
Written on it were the names of towns and the people who 
had helped him travel all the way from Holland to St. 
Malo. They were members of The Underground. He was 
from the Gestapo posing as a downed American flier. He 
had lived in Chicago for eleven years before the war. 
Doubtless, that experience helped him learn to speak 
English as well as he did. The French hung him in a barn 
before dawn and buried him under the carrots in a 
garden.

It was 
decided to split the group - too many men hiding in one 
place. Shaffer, Koval, Dulberg and Bill went to a 
garage (second floor) behind a hotel that housed German 
officers. They ate food from the same kitchen that 
prepared theirs and it was fine food. They smoked their 
cigars and cigarettes, too. The woman who ran the hotel 
had lived in Chicago for thirteen years. She wanted the 
Germans to stay at the hotel until the end of the war. 
They had killed her husband and she wanted revenge. She 
was optimistic that the American army would arrive some 
day and if the six officers were still occupying her 
hotel she wouldn’t have to find them. The day of 
reckoning arrived and she retaliated by killing them.

The 
Underground eventually moved Bill and Shaffer to Paris. 
In February 1944 they lived with Monsieur Ernest Bernard 
at #3 Rue de Emile Zola in the Livery Gargan section of 
Paris for over three weeks. Then they moved to a place 
on Avenue De La Convention.

In 
January 1944 eighty men of The Underground were lost 
because a spy penetrated the organization. Koval and 
Technical Sgt. Samuel M. Blatchford, 526th 
Squadron, radio operator-gunner on pilot 2nd 
Lt. Walter C. Euwer’s crew (Euwer was killed on the 
mission) were taken prisoner and spent the rest of the 
war in Stalag Luft III after many days of torture by the 
Gestapo.

Bill 
related an unbelievable incident that began on July 14, 
1943, Bastille Day. The ultimate conclusion came to 
light in February 1944 while he was in Paris. It 
pertains to the eleventh mission for the 379th 
and Bill flew on it. The target was an aircraft 
components plant located at Villa Coublay. There was a 
camera aboard his plane that was activated by the radio 
operator on the bomb run. It took pictures at 
three-second intervals. Approaching the target there 
were broken clouds but it could be seen. There was 
fighter opposition from Goering’s Yellow Nose Squadrons 
from Abbeyville and some “ack-ack” fire. The bombs were 
dropped. On the way home the B-17’s met their fighter 
escort about fifty miles from Paris and arrived safely.

After 
landing, he and other crew headed for the film 
processing laboratory anxious to see the photos as they 
came out of the developer. They were great! There were 
photos of the bombs leaving the bomb bay in a good 
cluster. One bomb, however, went off to the right 
immediately. Since they were at about 25,000 feet, it 
wasn’t likely that it would land near the others. 
Captain Paul Crum, the bombardier, and Bill took a good 
look at the series of photos and agreed that the bomb 
had a bent fin as it drifted out of the series of 
pictures. “Well,” Crum said, “it won’t hit anything.”

One 
day in February 1944 during Bill’s stay with Mr. 
Bernard, they, along with Shaffer, were talking about 
the war. Mr. Bernard remarked he was working in the 
machine shop at Le Bourget on Bastille Day in 1943 when 
American bombers came over about three o’clock in the 
afternoon. He said they were always glad when they came 
because all the workers quit and headed for the 
underground shelters as soon as the sirens started. He 
said when they returned, the machine shop was a real 
mess and the barracks, about two hundred yards away, 
hidden in the woods, were wiped out completely along 
with the German army personnel present. It was accurate 
bombing with all the bombs in a group except one.

Mr. 
Bernard said the one bomb landed two and a half miles 
away on a large German bomber set in concrete. It was a 
Heinkel III used to teach students how to load bombs and 
to study the bomb racks. It must have been the bomb 
that went astray, Bill thought.

“I 
don’t know how from that high in the air you could be so 
good at placing the bombs,” Mr. Bernard remarked. 
“That’s nothing,” Bill replied. “If there had been two 
planes set in concrete over there, we would have sent 
two bombs that way.” Shaffer almost swallowed his 
tongue when Bill told him in English what he had told 
Mr. Bernard in French.

In due 
time The Underground moved Bill and others by train to 
Toulouse. It took three days. From there they moved on 
to St. Godens, a ski resort town in the Pyrenees 
Mountains. Three weeks were spent there in sheepherder 
huts. Their number grew to sixteen airmen: two 
Australians, two Czechs, three English, one Dutch, and 
eight Americans. They were waiting for the snow to melt 
so they could cross the mountains into Spain. 

Around the first of May 1944, one night with three 
guides they walked thirty miles through streams with 
floating ice, and through snow into Spain. They arrived 
in the small town of Bosost and were promptly thrown in 
jail by the Spanish Frontier Guards. The Captain of the 
Guards let Bill use his phone to call the American 
consulate in Madrid but he could not speak in English. 
His French was good enough to make conversation. He 
told the embassy person that sixteen airmen were being 
held in Bosost. In a few hours they were out of jail 
and were taken to a hotel by the governor of the 
territory. The next day they moved on to Zaragoza and 
two weeks later to Madrid. Next stop Gibraltar. From 
there the Royal Air Force flew them to England.

Bill 
spent nine months and three days in France evading the 
Germans before reaching Spain and freedom. He traveled 
about one thousand miles aided by the French Resistance 
Group or The Underground. On one occasion he rode on a 
German troop train part way that was enroute to the 
Russian front.

Since 
the end of World War II, Bill has returned to France 
four times on visits. He has had the pleasure of 
meeting with some of the folks who were part of The 
Underground that helped him. “Let me tell you, it’s 
great to be alive!”
