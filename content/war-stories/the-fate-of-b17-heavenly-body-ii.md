It is 
1820 hours on 19 June, 1944. The sun is shining brightly 
in a clear blue sky. From the ground can be heard the 
throbbing of airplane engines approaching. Glancing up, 
one can see a formation of Flying Fortresses coming in 
to land at Kimbolton, home of the 379th Bomb Group. At 
this stage in the war, this is not an uncommon sight. 
The allied bomber forces were being used to hammer the 
German defenses which were holding up the allied forces 
in Normandy.

Taking off at 1440 hours that day, the Group had 
attacked German V-1 flying bomb-sites at Zudauasques/Enquine, 
France. 

As 
the aircraft crossed the Thames a number of eyewitness's 
observed one aircraft in trouble. Aircraft 44-6133 flown 
by Lt. A.J. Ramacilli was reported making loud whining 
noise. Lt. Lloyd Burns, pilot of 42-97942, christened 
“Heavenly Body II", takes up the story. 

"As 
we let down over the Thames Estuary, we encountered a 
layer of clouds. Losing sight of the horizon, but able 
to see aircraft immediately adjacent. By the time I 
realized that Lt. Kaufman was having trouble with this, 
he was already having to overcorrect somewhat having 
overshot our position on the lead plane." 

Burns 
had swapped seats with his copilot Kaufman to give him a 
chance at flying in the left-hand seat. Lt. Fred Kaufman 
was expecting to get his own crew soon and eagerly 
accepted the offer. He continues:

"I 
remember reaching over above Lt. Kaufman trying to push 
back the curtain to locate our left wingman, Ramacitti…then 
the crash…right into Fred… the tremendous grinding of 
metal, the roaring of the wind and the engines. I looked 
over at Sergeant Gibbs who was standing behind us. He 
was as pale as death, but OK. I jerked my thumb at him 
indicating get out. No one needed to be told that, of 
course, and Gibbs disappeared. I shook Kaufman with no 
response. 

I 
reached under my seat for the chest pack, it was gone. 
Apparently the collision had dislodged it. I unbuckled 
my seat belt and climbed down toward the hatch under the 
pilot's seat. The plane was going down, making progress 
difficult. I was looking for my parachute without 
success. Suddenly someone, I don't know who, maybe an 
angel, shoved one into my arms. My chute harness was 
completely unbuckled. So I buckled one leg and one 
buckle of the chute to one buckle of my chest harness."

As 
the men inside struggled to abandon the aircraft, 
observers from the ground watched spellbound. 
Eyewitness, C. T. Ellison, recalls the collision: 

"One 
of them broke up with the wings and fuselage dropping 
into the water. The crew bailed out. The other plane 
seemed to be OK, except that one engine was on fire."

Mr. 
D. Ball who was sixteen at the time was cycling along 
Marine Parade when the aircraft approached from Kent. He 
had heard the whining from one of the aircrafts engines 
and suddenly one B-17 flew straight into the other. Both 
airplanes locked together for an instant and then broke 
apart, one falling near Canvey. Mr. Ball saw at least 
one parachutist. 

Mrs. 
C. L. Evans was on Leigh Cliffs and saw the formation 
approach towards Leigh Station. Suddenly, one ship 
veered sideways and collided with the other ship. One 
dived away while the other flew around before seeming to 
attempt a landing on the mudflats, finally plunging in 
with a splash. 

As 
the aircraft circled the first parachutes appeared. 
Lloyd Burns takes up his story: 

"At 
this point, I saw that several of the crew were trying 
to get the hatch door open and could not. Not being 
completely buckled, I was not prepared to exit yet, but 
threw my weight against the door trying to break it 
loose. Apparently it gave way because the next thing I 
knew, I was floating down dangling half out of my 
harness.

Blood 
streamed down my face from a cut above my right eye. I 
must have struck something as I fell out of the plane, 
knocking me unconscious. I don't recall pulling the 
ripcord. I was hanging half way out of the partially 
buckled harness, so I tried to secure myself into it 
better, which resulted in a very frightening sway. So I 
just stopped trying and held on. I looked up and saw 
that one main shroud line was hooked to my harness.

I 
then looked down and began to worry about where I was 
going to land. I saw that I would be far from shore and 
I was not wearing my Mae West. The stupidity of 
youth…chute harness unbuckled, Mae West off, for 
comfort, of course. After all, the mission was over!

I hit 
the water hard and had trouble freeing myself from the 
chute harness. The wind dragged me for quite a distance, 
but finally the chute collapsed and I freed myself after 
sinking pretty deep trying to get out of my heavy 
sheepskin jacket, pants and boots. I began treading 
water in my underwear." 

The 
Flying Fortress was well known as a stable aircraft and 
fortunately for the crew of the Heavenly Body II, it 
descended in a flat circle. Many crews were trapped in 
their crashing aircraft as they spun earthwards. Some of 
the witnesses on the ground felt that the aircraft was 
being controlled during this descent, but this appears 
not to be the case…

Dick 
Andrews, waist gunner, had swapped positions with Louis 
Schulte and was flying tail gunner. As he recalls:

“The 
plane flying left wing seemed to be having difficulty in 
maintaining good position in flight and we all sort of 
had an eye out for the unusual flight attitude. 
Recalling a bit of humor just prior to the crash…Lloyd’s 
home state of Georgia is known as the Peach State and 
New Jersey, in my opinion, probably raises the best 
peaches. We were debating this issue at the moment of 
collision. We were hit on the top which rendered out 
controls useless, as the control cables all pass right 
down the top center of the fuselage.

There 
was no alarm sounded to bail out, we just knew the 
moment had come to get out. I attempted to jettison the 
escape hatch, but could not pull the pins free. I turned 
the latch knob and pushed the door open against the 
slipstream as I pulled myself through the narrow 
opening. Knowing our position, I chose to open my chute 
immediately after clearing other planes in formation.

I 
can remember vividly falling through the air on my back 
and looking up at the formation heading home and seeing 
two open slots where we should have been. My chute was a 
Pioneer back pack which had a long ripcord and required 
a hard pull to open. I didn’t know how difficult it was 
to open until I tried. The opening of the chute was a 
severe shock which I felt for some time. As high in the 
air as I was, I had time to look around and to thank 
God. I was able to look down and count the other chutes 
well below me and wonder whether the seven I counted 
belonged to my crew or the other plane. 

I saw 
one of the Forts circling in apparently stable flight 
(well trimmed). The plane hit the ground heading 
roughly easterly and narrowly missing an oil storage 
tank before blowing up. I believe that I was the only 
person to actually land on the ground; the others fell 
into the water some distance away. I don’t know if the 
exact spot would be visible today. There was a high 
stone seawall built with large rocks which protected the 
shoreline. Where I landed was in three feet of slimy, 
black stinky mud. My chute did not collapse immediately 
but dragged me along for some distance before snagging 
and spilling the air. In the meantime, my flight suit 
scooped up the mud and filled it full. I smoothed my 
hair back, which ultimately dried into a hard shell. I 
climbed the seawall and could see a small village off in 
the distance, I presume, about two or three kilometers.

I 
hiked off to find help. The people who met me were very 
friendly and warm knowing what had just happened. One 
woman invited me into her home and said she wished she 
could offer me a bath but they had no bath tub. Several 
other women brought me food, which was in short supply, 
but they were very generous. I asked for help in getting 
information about the rest of my crew. Someone summoned 
a local Bobby who offered to help. He took me to his 
home where his wife gave me some fresh cherries while he 
was arranging transportation to an RAF Mosquito Bomber 
base somewhere to the south of the Thames River. 

On 
arriving there, I went to the tower for information 
about the accident. They hadn’t received word of any 
rescue at that time. I was given quarters in a lovely, 
large, stone home that was being used by the RAF 
Officers. There I was able to bath and had a good meal 
with the pilots. Later that evening, I heard that most 
of my crew had been picked by "Air Sea Rescue" and were 
in the hospital for the night. They did not have the 
names of those rescued, so I still had to wonder. 

The 
next day, a young woman pilot flew me to a Spitfire base 
I thought was Gravesend. There I met the other survivors 
from my crew and the bombardier from the other plane…the 
only survivor from that crew. We were picked up by a 
Fort from our home field at Kimbolton. Two days later, 
we started flying the balance of our missions. I flew 
my thirty missions between April and July, 1944." 

Jack 
Gray, our bombardier had officially completed his tour 
of operations on a sortie earlier that day. He was still 
ordered to go on the afternoon mission by the Group 
Operations Officer. Jack recalls: 

"After we made our bomb run, it was like a cake walk 
because there was no flak or fighters as we headed back 
across the channel. The group leader, instead of 
beginning our letdown as we left the French Coast, 
maintained altitude until we were over the English 
coast. As we started letting down through a thick high 
level of clouds, I was relaxing with my feet propped up 
on the bombsight. At approximately 19,000 feet we were 
hit by our left wingman on their first combat sortie. 
Possibly he lost sight of us in the clouds and he came 
down on top of us in his blind spot. The Plexiglas nose 
cone was knocked off at impact and I found myself more 
out of the plane than in it. Miraculously, I stopped my 
fall and fought to pull myself back into the plane. My 
first problem was to get back inside the aircraft to get 
my parachute. I wasn't having much success until the 
plane started its nose dive and the slipstream helped 
push me back inside.

I put 
on my chute and gave a questioning thumbs up to my 
navigator. He signaled back that he was OK. At impact, 
our intercom system was rendered inoperative so we could 
only communicate by hand signals. We looked back toward 
the escape hatch only to find the pilot and Sgt. Gibbs 
were already crowded into the narrow space meant to 
accommodate only one man. The pilot was trying to push 
and shove Gibbs through the hatch. To have proceeded to 
the hatch would have only added to the chaos and maybe 
no one would have gotten out. I sat on an ammo can while 
the navigator kept watch for our escape route to clear. 
Finally Eddy, our navigator, gave the all clear sign, we 
exchanged silent OK's and I motioned for him to get out 
He was still adjusting his chute and emphatically 
signaled to me to go. That was the last time I saw Eddy 
alive. 

Now 
comes problem number two, I found the escape hatch still 
in place. It wasn't supposed to be. I guessed that the 
emergency release must have malfunctioned. Moving feet 
first in the direction of the tail of the ship, I put 
all of my weight against the hatch. Suddenly, my 
progress was stopped because my chute harness had become 
caught on the hatch handle. My adrenaline really started 
to flow then because I had no idea of our altitude or 
how much time was left for me to get out of the plane. 
It was now or never. I grasped the hatchway frame and 
literally levered myself out of the plane. 

Heavenly Body ll's gradual descent was what allowed so 
many of us to survive. The other airplane, 44-6133, 
dived into the Thames taking all but one man with it. 
Finally with smoke pouring from the starboard engine, 
aircraft, 42-97942, took a descent angle of 45 degrees 
and plunged nose first into the mud, burning fiercely 
and creating a deep hole. Mr. Payne of Canvey recalled 
that when he arrived on the scene, ammunition was still 
exploding in the fire and one of the engines had been 
thrown forward and was laying in a gully on the marshes. 
He and Mr. R. Layman, Payne's father-in-law to be, 
helped carry the body of one crew member across the 
marsh to the sea wall. This was Flight Officer Sadler. 
Tail gunner Sgt. Louis Schulte who had swapped positions 
with Sgt. Dick Andrews was recovered dead in the Thames. 
Both received the Distinguished Flying Cross 
posthumously on 29 June, 1944."

Radio 
operator Leroy Monk of the Burns' crew had this 
recollection of that fateful day: 

"I 
remember we received a big bump and crashing sound on 
the top of the plane. I looked through the top window of 
the radio room and could see part of another B-17. My 
escape route was the bomb bay but my door forward was 
bent by the impact so that I could not get it open. I 
made my way back to the waist where the ball turret 
gunner was trying to release the rear door which was 
also stuck. I sat on the floor and began kicking on the 
door until it gave way. I remember the tail gunner and 
the waist gunner were standing behind me waiting to 
jump. Since I was already sitting in the doorway, I 
decided to jump. I tipped forward but my rear end 
parachute straps held me back. When I tumbled forward 
with the help of the planes spin, I went too fast and 
hit the tail of the plane, my chute opened and tore away 
three panels. Very, very lucky. Once I was floating 
down, I could see the bombardier and waist gunner 
descending and no one else. Also, I could see the other 
plane in a slow spin and saw it hit an island and ours 
coming apart piece by piece. 

When 
I landed in the channel, I found my chute tangled around 
my legs. I couldn't get loose and the chute was filling 
with water and pulling me under. My life preserver would 
pull me up again. The water was cold and I was getting 
tired.

I 
then saw what I think was a fishing boat coming toward 
me, but I guess because of the whitecaps they didn't see 
me until the last second. Consequently, they broad sided 
me and went on. Can't say how long it was before another 
boat came along and they threw me about a one inch rope 
which I catch, but couldn't hold on to because of the 
slickness of the brine and my exhausted state. They also 
went on and I figured that I would drown and being so 
exhausted I really didn't care. Sometime later…have no 
idea how long, I felt myself choking and found that 
another boat was there and was pulling me out of the 
water with a boat hook fastened on the collar of my 
jacket. They pulled me aboard, pumped me out, and rolled 
me in a blanket. To my surprise, my engineer was sitting 
close by leaning against the cabin of the ship. 

I 
must have fainted then because the next thing I remember 
was my engineer and I in an English hospital where I 
must have slept for at least two days. We were flown 
back to Kimbolton and there discovered we had lost our 
copilot, navigator, and tail gunner. I was told that 
only the bombardier survived from the other crew. After 
a three day pass, we finished our missions and were 
shipped home.”

Ball 
turret gunner Bill Farmer tells his story as follows:

"This was our second mission that day. Our crew had 
already flown 26 missions and we found ourselves mixed 
in with another crew. We went back to France without 
incident and as we were leaving the coast, I rolled my 
gun turret so that the guns pointed down and I opened 
the hatch and climbed out into the waist compartment. My 
guess is that we were about 20,000 feet when the plane 
off our left wing slid over us and made contact. I later 
learned it was the crew we had divided up with on the 
morning mission. Our plane started to shake and went 
into a dive. I grabbed my chest pack parachute and 
snapped it on to the front and looked around for the 
others. Doc remained in place by his waist gun but was 
obviously hurt by the impact with the other plane. Leroy 
Monk, the radio operator, was sifting in the rear 
doorway with his feet hanging out as though transfixed. 
I motioned for him to jump, the vibrations and the wind 
noises were to loud we could not be heard. He was 
hanging on tightly and blocking the doorway; I screamed 
at him to grab his parachute ring and then gave him a 
mighty shove. I watched as his chute hit the horizontal 
stabilizer and burst open. Several days later when I met 
up with Monk, the first thing he did was come up to me 
and thanked me for pushing him out of the plane. I then 
went back to Doc who was not moving so I crawled up to 
the doorway and positioned myself to jump. Out I went 
and, after counting to ten, I pulled the ripcord. Just 
then, there was an explosion so close that I could feel 
the heat and the force pushing me sideways. 

I 
floated down thinking that everything was OK. The ring 
was still in my hand and I thought of keeping it as a 
souvenir. The snap of the opening chute caused my flight 
boots and heated shoes to fall off, but this was not a 
concern because I was headed down into the water below. 
My training told me to unhook the chest buckle on my 
chute and then the leg buckles about ten or twenty feet 
above the water, so that I could let myself drop clear 
of the parachute before it could come down on top of me 
and tangle me up so I could not swim away.

On 
looking down, I could see no boats and the shoreline 
seemed several miles away. Looking down to decide when 
and how to judge the distance to the water was not 
helpful as I soon found myself in cold water with eight 
to ten feet swells and being pulled like a sailboat by 
my inflated parachute and one leg strap. After changing 
from holding on to my arm strap and then my leg strap a 
few times, looking back I noticed a fishing boat coming 
to one side at about 90 degrees from the direction I was 
being blown. I assumed he would slow down and my 
parachute would be blown into the side of the boat and I 
would be pulled on board. No such luck, as the boat was 
crossing the path of where the chute and I were 
traveling, the wind came out of the parachute and it 
started to collapse. As the boat passed by the wind 
picked up and started pulling me again. It was close to 
the boat, but not close enough so one of the men on 
board jumped off to grab the parachute but missed and 
away I went. I watched as the boat started to turn to go 
back and pick up their crew member. So much for rescue 
at sea. With my speed slowing down and my chute 
collapsing, I felt the muddy bottom under my feet. My 
first thought was now that I’ve done all of this, some 
large fish was after me. I released my harness and 
looking back to sea I saw a rowboat with four men 
heading my way and motioning me to come to the boat. By 
now, I was extremely cold and I didn't have a clue 
whether I was in England or France. After twenty minutes 
in the water, I was totally numb and had to be dragged 
into the boat which then was rowed back to the fishing 
boat nearby. My whole body was shaking and shivering. On 
deck, they gave me a mug of very hot tea that was great 
just to hold in my cold hands, but when I tried to drink 
the tea it was so hot that it blistered the roof of my 
mouth. 

The 
fishermen were part of a Norwegian fleet and spoke in 
broken English and said that they had seenthe 
accident and came over to help. They took me to the 
captain's quarters and told me to get out of my wet 
clothes and into his bunk. Even with four or five 
blankets, I couldn't stop shaking. The captain came in 
and said he could stop the shivering and handed me a 
bottle of scotch to nurse on until he could get me to 
the pier at the RAF Air Sea Rescue station. He outfitted 
me with dry clothes consisting of a pair of pants, a 
jacket and a pair rubber boots. The pants came up to my 
armpits and the swallow tail jacket touched the deck and 
the huge pair of rubber boots came up above my knees. I 
couldn't help but notice that the captain whose clothes 
I was wearing was almost seven feet tall. 

Probably half plastered with the captain holding one 
arm and another seaman holding the other, I was lead out 
on deck to go ashore. I thanked them all, especially the 
seaman who jumped in the water to grab my parachute as 
it passed. 

I 
became aware that we were tied up to another boat and 
not the pier. I was greeted by a lot of other seamen as 
we, two seamen and a half bombed Yank in formal attire, 
navigated toward the pier across boats that did not know 
how to go up and down with the boat next to it! I really 
suspect that I was entertainment for all the people 
watching the seamen trying to get the Yank on shore.

At 
the RAF station, I was able to take a hot shower and put 
on some better fitting clothes. They gave me some under 
shorts and a hand knitted turtle neck sweater which I 
still have today. Then they took me into a large room 
to look at two bodies which I was not able to identify 
because of their injuries. No one would tell me how many 
survivors there were from the two airplanes. 

After several hours with the RAF, I was taken to an R&R 
place for observation. It was a large house that had 
been converted into a semi-hospital. I was not given any 
information or any agenda for my return to the 379th at 
Kimbolton. Three days later, with good-byes to my new 
friends, I was driven by an AAF driver back to the base. 
There I was brought up to date on the collision and what 
had happened to our crew members and the others 
involved. 

After two more missions on a lead crew, I completed my 
thirty missions. The last flight was on the 4th of July 
1944. I returned soon after to the U.S. to become a 
Cadet in the class 45-H to become a pilot in the AAF.

****

The 
wreckage of the aircraft remained on Canvey Point. 
Occasionally more items came to the surface with the 
action of the tides. Pieces were removed by souvenir 
hunters when recovery became popular in the late sixties 
and seventies. This site was easily accessible and was 
popular with a number of aircraft recovery groups. The Southend Historic Aircraft Society salvaged and 
recovered numerous artifacts from the plane that were 
displayed at a museum maintained by the Society until it 
was finally closed. There are still some members of the 
community there who remember how these young men died in 
their common cause giving up their tomorrows so that we 
may have our today. 

This 
account of "The Fate of Flying Fortress Heavenly Body 
Two" was compiled by a young Englishman, who became very 
interested in what happened on that fateful day, 19 
June, 1944. He became obsessed with finding the 
surviving men. Checking through official records, he was 
able to find the home addresses of the men. Many of the 
addresses had changed, but eventually all of the crew 
was located. Mr. Jasper then contacted each one and gave 
them the other’s addresses. My wife and I made a trip 
around the country visiting each of them. We are now all 
in touch with each other and have made several of the 
379th reunions together. If it hadn't been for Mr. 
Jasper, we probably would have never seen each other 
again. In fact, Lloyd Burns, the pilot, and Jack Gray, 
the bombardier, lived only a few blocks apart, in 
Sacramento, CA, and never met until after hearing from 
Mr. Jasper. Mr. Jasper has come to America and visited 
with me, in New Jersey, and with Bill Farmer in 
California, while on business trips.
