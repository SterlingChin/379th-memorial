THE BIRMINGHAM JEWELL by Alvin J. Anderson

On April 19, 1944 our crew was assigned to a new B-17G, 
aircraft no. 4297678. Our pilot, 2nd Lt. Walter W. Smith, 
named and painted the name on the nose. He named it after 
his wife, Jewell, and hometown Birmingham, Alabama. So from 
then on it was known as the Birmingham Jewell. It was my 
fifteenth mission. The crew included Lt. Smith, Pilot; 2nd 
Lt. Ralph J. Brocato, Copilot; 2nd Lt. Raymond W. Connor, 
Bombardier; T/Sgt. Joseph Diorio, Nose Gunner; S/Sgt. Alvin 
J. Anderson, Flight Engineer/Top Turret Gunner; S/Sgt. 
Oval 
Greenmyer, 
Radio Operator/Gunner; S/Sgt. John J. Bodnar, 
Ball Turret Gunner; S/Sgt. John J. Falbo, Right Waist 
Gunner; S/Sgt. Leonard W. Leedy, Left Waist Gunner; S/Sgt. 
Joseph L. Prevost, Tail Gunner. The target that day was 
Kassel/Waldau and Eschwege, Germany to bomb aircraft 
assembly plants. My thirtieth and last mission that I flew 
in The Jewell was on June 10, 1944, to Vannes, France to 
bomb an air-drome.

The Jewell was a great B-17. It was an easy plane to fly and 
very dependable. She flew her one-hundredth mission on 
November 10th, 1944. The target was an airdrome at Ostheim, 
Germany. On February 3, 1945 she flew her one hundred and 
twenty-eighth mission, which was her last. The target was 
railroad marshalling yards near Berlin. Upon losing an 
engine near Berlin the plane had to drop out of formation 
and try to get back to England on its own. Three German 
ME-109s shot her down. Four of the nine crew members were 
killed.

At this time The Jewell had flown more missions than any 
other B-17 in the Eighth Air Force. Later there were others 
that surpassed this number. Aboard the ill-fated plane were 
1st. Lt. William A. Webber, Pilot, KIA; 2nd Lt. James T. 
Kiester, Copilot, MIA; 2nd Lt. Thomas A. Pickett, Navigator, 
POW; S/Sgt. Raymond Wetherbee, Nose Gunner, KIA; T/Sgt. Carl 
E. McHenry, Radio Operator/Gunner, KIA; T/Sgt. Harold F. 
Francis, Flight Engineer/Top Turret Gunner, MIA; S/Sgt. 
William T. Walls, Ball Turret Gunner, KIA; S/Sgt. William W. 
Scarffe, Waist Gunner, POW; Sgt. Bennett D. Howell, Tail 
Gunner, POW.

The 379th BG (H) B-17G, OL' GAPPY, assigned to the 524th 
Squadron is credited with flying 157 combat missions, more 
than any other heavy bomber in the 8th Air Force. Historian 
Roger Freeman reports it in the book, THE MIGHTY EIGHTH.

A 
GALLANT TRY

To make an understatement, the success of the "career" of 
the B-17s flying combat was dependent on the ground crews 
and specialists who maintained them. This included crew 
chiefs and the men who worked on them on the flight line. 
Then there were specialists who were assigned to the service 
squadron or service group and worked in the shops. Major 
repairs were made there on badly shot-up fuselages, wings 
and tail assemblies; engines were overhauled; instruments, 
radios, propellers were refurbished, to name some of the 
specialty work done by ground personnel to "Keep 'em 
flying!"

Whatever happened to the Beautiful Birds over enemy 
territory where the lurking Luftwaffe roamed and pockets of 
flak cluttered the blue sky, both potentially dangerous, was 
beyond the control of the dedicated ground personnel whose 
work on the Flying Fortresses enabled them to soar into "The 
Wild Blue Yonder."
