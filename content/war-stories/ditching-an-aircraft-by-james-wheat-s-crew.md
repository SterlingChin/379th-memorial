DITCHING AN AIRCRAFT by James Wheat's Crew

Among 
the risks of flying a combat mission was the possibility 
of having to ditch a damaged plane or one without enough 
fuel to return to England. The watery runways in this 
case could be the North Sea, Strait of Dover or the 
English Channel. Pilot, 1st Lt. James R. Wheat, 
Co-pilot, 2nd Lt. Leslie Nielsen, and S/Sgt. William J. 
Sullivan, Jr., tell what it was like to experience the 
ditching of their B-17G. Although each contributor to 
this article tells something about the same happening in 
some instances, they also relate incidents that they, 
alone, endured.

****

The 
mission to Hamburg on June 20, 1944 started out much the 
same as all of our previous ones. My crew and I had not 
flown since June 14th. All of us had been on pass to 
London. We had been rather busy, having flown our first 
on April 10, 1944 and this was the 28th in 80 days.

The 
crew was composed of myself, 1st Lt. James R. Wheat, 
pilot; 2nd Lt. Leslie (NMI) Nielsen, co-pilot; 2nd Lt. 
Walter M. Cooney, navigator; 2nd Lt. George D. Berner, 
bombardier; T/Sgt. Calvin 0. Decker, top turret gunner; 
T/Sgt. George R. Maisch, radio operator and gunner; 
S/Sgt. William J. Sullivan, Jr., ball turret gunner; 
S/Sgt. Robert (NMI) Mercado, waist gunner; S/Sgt. Alvin 
T. Carter, tail gunner.

The 
527th Squadron was not scheduled to fly this mission, 
but we were alerted to fly spare along with two other 
crews. We were assigned a position in the lead group 
formation and the first AC was airborne at 0445. The 
wing assembled over Molesworth at 0549 hours at 5,000 
ft. We departed the English coast at Maplethorpe. It was 
0621 hours at 7,400 ft. The enemy coast was crossed at 
Orking at 0819 hours at 25,000 ft. The target was an oil 
refinery.

****

Everything went along about normal until we left the IP, 
which was about a 10-minute run at 25,000 ft. Less than 
1 minute before bombs away we encountered very heavy and 
accurate flak and a push rod went through the side of 
the No. 1 engine and it was throwing oil. Co-pilot, 
Nielsen feathered the prop and I threw full power on the 
three other engines. No. 3 engine was hit by a flak and 
lost oil pressure and could not be feathered. We managed 
to stay in formation long enough to drop the bombs with 
the group. No. 2 engine was also hit and was on fire. We 
could not stay with the formation and dropped out with 
two engines out and No. 3 engine prop windmilling. We 
were down to 23,000 ft. but the fire had gone out on No. 
2 engine— but it was leaking oil.

We 
were putting all the power I dared on the No. 2 and No. 
4 engines, but with the No. 3 engine windmilling we had 
a lot of drag and were losing altitude. Two hours later 
we were down to 15,000 ft. We had already contacted 
Air-Sea Rescue by radio and told them that we expected 
to have to ditch. We were reporting in to Air-Sea Rescue 
every 30 minutes or so and giving them a progress 
report. They would take a fix on our position. At 15,000 
ft. I ordered the crew to throw everything out of the 
plane that they could get loose. And they did. At about 
this time we lost No. 2 engine, but Nielsen got it 
feathered. We were losing altitude at about 700 ft. per 
minute and were indicating about 90 miles per hour. All 
the crewmembers except myself and co-pilot Nielsen were 
in the radio room in their ditching positions. We had an 
under cast from about 800 ft. down to 500 ft. I did not 
have much time to pick a heading for our final approach 
to the water. The wind was blowing about 50 miles per 
hour and the swells were high. We were in contact with 
Air-Sea Rescue for the last minute or so of our descent 
and they had a good fix on our position. We made a good 
landing in the water but the sea was so rough that the 
plane broke in two at the ball turret, co-pilot Nielsen 
and I went out the windows on our respective sides.

The 
first thing I noticed after getting into the water was 
the crew in the radio room had not gotten the life rafts 
to release from the top of the plane where they were 
stored. My thoughts were to try and reach the external 
release for them. I would swim up to the plane and 
before I could reach the release handles, a wave would 
break over the plane and wash me back out to the end of 
the left wing. I made two attempts at releasing them 
before the crew finally succeeded. 

About 
this time one of the two, one-man life rafts that we 
carried in the radio room washed up in front of me. I 
grabbed it and pulled the release to inflate it, as well 
as my “Mae West” vest that all of the crew wore. By this 
time all of the crew had gotten into the water on the 
left side of the plane, but the raft that released on 
the right side of the plane had broken loose and floated 
away from us. We managed to hang on to the raft from the 
left side of the plane and tied it to the one-man raft 
that I had gotten hold of. By now the plane had sunk. I 
would guess that it did not float more than 2 or 3 
minutes. Nobody seemed to be hurt too badly, but 
bombardier Berner was dazed. We found out later that he 
had received a concussion.

Perhaps it would help to give an account by ball turret 
gunner Sullivan, from his diary, of the events. So I’ll 
turn this story over to him.

“The 
boys had been there a few days before, (the June 18th, 
1944 mission to Hamburg) while we were on a pass and 
told us about the flak so we expected a rough time in 
that regard, but not as much as we received. 

Procedure was normal until we turned on our IP and 
number one engine started to act up. We just about 
feathered it and started on the bomb run when “All Hell’ 
broke loose. The flak was the most severe we had ever 
encountered and each burst seemed to be aimed at our 
particular are squadron.

After 
a few close bursts, number 2 started to burn and number 
3 was knocked out. We tried to feather number 3 but “no 
soap,” so we just had to let it windmill.

The 
pilot told us to put on our chutes, for he thought it 
was all over for us. We fell out of formation after 
dropping our bombs and started in the general direction 
of home. 

The 
smoke had stopped coming out of number 2, but it was 
pouring oil. We were losing altitude but everything 
seemed to be under control. The pilot got in touch with 
Air-Sea Rescue and told them of our plight. At about 
10,000 ft., we started throwing out equipment, when the 
pilot informed us that we would probably have to ditch.

The 
radio room was cleared of all unnecessary equipment and 
we prepared to take our stations. While still 
descending, we went over our duties and ditching 
procedure, each man making sure of what he was to do. 
The radioman remained on interphone, informing us of our 
altitude and distance from shore. When about 6 miles out 
the pilot told us that it would be any minute now. 
Everyone braced themselves, as we could feel the plane 
slowing down for the attempted landing.

The 
first crash was slight as it was only the tail hitting 
the water, then in a few seconds the big impact came. 
Water came in from everywhere and we were tossed about 
like corks. I landed face down in the water, in the 
opposite direction from which I had been sitting. The 
floor of the radio room gave way and we all went down. 
When I regained my senses I was under water but soon 
came up, as we all had half of our “Mae Wests” inflated. 
I grabbed for an oxygen hose and some wires on the right 
side and tried to pull myself up. I could feel someone’s 
body underneath me as I started to climb out the hatch. 
The tail gunner was partly out and trying to pull the 
life raft release. He told me to step on his arm and 
when I did he gave another yank and the life raft popped 
out. The plane had broken in half at the ball turret and 
was sinking fast. The second raft appeared and I jumped 
into the water and grabbed a rope on it. The first one 
was washed away before anyone could get to it, so we all 
held on to the other one. A K-dingy floated into the 
pilot’s arms and he inflated that. I kicked myself away 
from the wing of the plane as I thought there might be a 
suction created, but it just slowly slid out of sight.

The 
bombardier was floundering around so we managed to get 
him in the large raft. Then the co-pilot and waist 
gunner climbed in, followed by the radioman. That left 
the engineer, the navigator and myself in the water, as 
the pilot had climbed in the one-man raft. By this time 
the sea had become quite rough and both rafts were 
shipping water. The ones in the raft attempted to bail 
out some of the water but each wave would fill it again. 
With the pump in the raft, they tried to pump up the 
seats so that another man could enter, but the position 
of the bombardier made it difficult.

We 
saw a buoy about fifty yards away and attempted to 
paddle towards it but were swept by too quickly. Between 
the swells we could see the top of a tower and a beacon 
on land, so we knew we weren’t too far out.

After 
about forty minutes someone spotted a launch heading our 
way and everyone felt better. My arms were quite tired 
from holding on and my body was shivering from the cold 
water but the sight of the boat seemed to give me 
strength and I knew it would only be a matter of minutes 
before we were picked up. As the boat came by, they 
threw over a net and lines and pulled is towards them. 
In no time we were all aboard, exhausted but happy and 
shaking hands with all the crew. They seemed almost as 
happy to see us.”

And, 
here is an account of the ditching from co-pilot 
Nielsen. “Our squadron was not supposed to fly this 
mission but they needed one more spare ship so we were 
assigned to it. We had just returned from pass while all 
the others had been flying.

Two 
crews were late arriving for briefing so the Colonel 
scrubbed them and put us in their place. We didn’t like 
the idea because we knew it would be a rough mission. 
However we set about with the preparations.

Everything went along smoothly until we got on the bomb 
run, then things began to happen fast. A half minute 
before bombs away the number 1 engine started throwing 
oil, the cause being a push rod through the engine, so I 
feathered it. About the same time number 3 engine was 
hit by flak and lost oil pressure. I tried to feather 
that also, but was unsuccessful; this caused a lot of 
drag. Number 2 engine also was hit and was on fire. By 
that time we had dropped our bombs and dropped back from 
the formation. We lost some altitude but did get the 
fire put out. With the number 2 and 4 engines pulling 
full rated power, number 3 windmilling, creating drag, 
we managed to hold our altitude for nearly 2 hours.

During this time we contacted the base by radio, got a 
QDM and fix also telling them we expected to ditch in 
the channel. About 50 miles from England we lost the 
number 2 engine at 15,000 ft. altitude and knew we would 
have to ditch. We contacted Air-Sea Rescue again and 
told them the situation so they kept a constant fix on 
us all the way down. We lost altitude at the rate of 700 
ft. per minute and were flying at ninety miles an hour. 
All but Jim and I went back to the radio room to clear 
out any loose equipment and to take ditching stations. 
We made a good landing in the water, only five miles 
from shore, but the sea was very rough and the ship 
broke up very badly from the bomb bay back. Jim and I 
were first ones out and it seemed a long time before any 
of the others came out. Carter got the life rafts out 
and they filled up quickly. We let one get away from us, 
which didn’t help any, but Jim got hold of a one-man 
dingy and got into that. I was first into the big raft 
and helped get Berner in, as he seemed to be dizzy and 
quite helpless. After a fashion, we got Mercado, Maisch 
and Carter into the raft, in that order. As the dinghy 
was almost full of water and not completely inflated the 
others stayed in the water while I started to pump more 
air into the raft and bail water out. Cooney, Decker, 
and Sullivan never did get into the raft as we sighted 
the rescue boats coming, so they just hung on and 
waited. On the boat the British treated us wonderful. 
They undressed us, dried us off, rubbed us down, and 
then dressed us in warm woolen clothes. At the naval 
base they gave us a complete GI issue of clothes, fed us 
and did everything to make us comfortable. We remained 
overnight and the base sent a Fort to pick us up and 
bring us back

Flak 
over the target was the most accurate and concentrated I 
have ever seen. Our target was a synthetic oil refinery 
and we got some very good hits on it. Flames and smoke 
could be seen 15,000 ft. high and reports indicated it 
was still burning two days later. General Travis led our 
group on the mission. Plane #261. It turned out that we 
were about 5 or 6 miles from England, just off the coast 
of Great Yarmouth in the North Sea when this mission was 
completed. We had ditched at about 11:30 and picked up 
about 12:10 by Air-Sea Rescue, which was a branch of the 
Royal Navy of Great Britain.

I 
don’t think I could add a whole lot to the story after 
51 years, except to say, we all lived to tell the story, 
and survived because of team work, on behalf of all the 
crew and the training we had received."
