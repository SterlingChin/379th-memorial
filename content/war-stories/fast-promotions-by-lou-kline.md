FAST PROMOTIONS by Lou Kline

I 
enlisted at the age of 16, graduated from Airplane 
Mechanics School, B-24 Specialist School, Gunnery 
School, and was assigned to a B-17 crew before I was old 
enough to enlist. In 1941 when I enlisted the minimum 
age was 18. To top it all off I was a 17 year old 
Technical Sergeant assigned to Sam Satariano’s crew in 
the 379th Bomb Group at Boise, Idaho.

Time passed 
and the crews flew the ocean, and were transferred to 
Kimbolton before our ground support units had arrived.

Having no MP’s to guard our aircraft, it became 
necessary for the crew members to take turns guarding 
the aircraft at night. It was Sgt Ellsworth Tibbetts 
turn to guard the airplane and he wanted to take my 
Thompson sub-machine to perform that duty, and I agreed.

The gun was in a leather scabbard that was hard as 
wood and it was jammed in, to the point that it took a 
really good tug to get it out, and it had a loaded clip 
in it. I yanked hard and the gun came out, firing one 
round into the floor of the hut. Apparently a hard 
leather tit on the inside of the scabbard had pushed the 
bolt back when the gun was pushed in.

When TSgt. 
Don Perry quit dancing around we found that the bullet 
had just grazed his shoe and it was quite hot. While we 
were concerned about him, Tibbetts wiped a tiny trickle 
of blood off his cheek. A tiny particle of the 
projectile had hit him. Everyone else was laughing at 
Perry dancing but I didn’t consider it so funny.

Knowing that someone outside was bound to have heard the 
shot I decided to tell the Squadron Commander, two huts 
away, what had happened. He was in bed when I reported 
and continued to lie there while I told my story. He 
asked if anyone had been hurt and I related Perry’s 
dance and Tibbets bloodletting.

Captain Jon Hall 
worried and agonized for several minutes before he said 
“Kline, if I don’t take some drastic action in this 
regard it would be a bad precedent for the entire 
Squadron, and I am going to have to bust you”. I asked 
“how far” and he said “all the way”. I felt very sick at 
the stomach and almost broke into tears. My folks at 
home were so proud of their teen age TSgt, and how would 
I break the news to them? I went away heartsick.

Several days passed and we were ready to go into combat 
on May 29th to St Nazaire. My crew stood down, but they 
woke me to substitute on Lt. Holmes crew as 
Engineer/Gunner. I told the Operations Officer that I 
could not fly because I was not a Sergeant. (That being 
the custom in that day to protect a crew member when 
being assigned to a Prison Camp) The Ops Officer said 
“are you still a Private” and of course I answered yes, 
whereupon he said “get down to the chow hall and then to 
briefing, and it will all be straightened out when you 
get back.” We aborted the mission and I didn’t pursue 
the point with Operations until they woke me for a 
mission with my crew when we repeated the same old story 
and Ops gave me the same answer. I needed to be at least 
a Buck Sergeant. In the meantime the one letter I sent 
home had my old rank in the return address. My Pilot, 
Sam, had taken advantage of the situation to promote my 
Assistant Engineer, 30 year old Beaufort Buchanan to 
TSgt.

Two missions later after asking to talk to 
our new Squadron Commander I came home from the mission 
and I was a TSgt again. The Squadron Commander that 
reduced me was shot down (in my aircraft) on the first 
mission and because I never saw any orders reducing me 
or promoting me, I feel like he never did it. Someone 
else told me that he saw a set of orders demoting me and 
promoting me on the same sheet. When I pulled that dumb 
trick we had no Orderly Room Staff and it might never 
have come to be….Or I had been reduced and promoted back 
to the same grade in a matter of two weeks.
