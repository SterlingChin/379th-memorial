PFC 
Adolph Cello, 526th Squadron Ordannce Detachment, 379th 
BG(H), sitting on a 1,000lb bomb holding two tail fuses. 
Circa: 1943-45.

A Bombardment Group airfield 
of the 8th Air Force was essentially a self-contained 
community. The servicemen who populated it represented a 
wide variety of Military Occupational Specialists other 
than fliers. All of them played a cooperative role in 
the successful operation and maintenance of a United 
States Army Air Force bomber base so the job of 
effectively bombing enemy targets could be accomplished. 
Adolph Cello served as a PFC in the 526th Squadron 
Ordnance detachment for most of the time the 379th was 
operational at Kimbolton. He tells what his work was 
like. He finished his service in a different role that 
will be revealed in his story. Enlisting in the service 
on November 4, 1942, I had six months of basic training 
including ordnance school at various camps. I was 
shipped out on the Aquitania May 9, 1943, destination 
unknown. After a number of days at sea the ship docked 
in the Firth of Clyde near Glasgow, Scotland. From there 
we boarded a train that took us to Kimbolton where we 
were assigned to Nissen huts. 

The following day some men pulled guard duty and others 
KP. A few days later our ordnance officer, Lt. H. B. 
McClanahan, assigned us to our duties. We went to the 
bomb storage area and lined up each bomb according to 
poundage. Completing this task, the bombs had to be 
camouflaged. Fuses were stored in a different area. The 
routine when it came time to load bombs aboard the B-17s 
went like this: We were awakened at an early hour in the 
morning. If some of the fellows had just gotten back 
from pass, you hear a bit of grumping. We got into 
our trucks and drove to the storage site to load bombs 
and fins on trailers. Two men were assigned to a plane. 
Rain made the site very muddy and the bitter cold made 
the bombs very difficult to handle. Fog made it somewhat 
rough since we had to drive slowly to stay on the roads. 
When we got to the runways we had to be careful that we 
didn't damage any planes. We had to use an energizer 
that was plugged into the belly of the plane since we 
weren't allowed to use the planes batteries. One of 
us went into the cockpit to open the bomb bay doors and 
snap the lights on in the bomb bay. We then shoved the 
bomb trailer under the bomb bay doors. Two armorer men 
were assigned to a B- 17 to set up the crank to lower 
the cable to the bomb trailer and a strap had to be 
placed under the bomb. The cable was hooked to the strap 
and the armorers had to crank the bomb to the top. 
Ordnance men put the fins on the bombs that were hung on 
both sides of the bomb bay. After the planes were loaded 
the section chief, a Tech Sergeant, delivered
fuses 
to each plane. The nose and tail fuse would be inserted 
and the arming wire was put through the fuses that was 
then placed with a safety pin. If the mission was 
scrubbed we returned to the planes and disarmed all 
fuses, removed the bombs and returned them to the 
storage site. By the time we got through it usually was 
daylight. We were so exhausted that some of us hit the 
sack instead of going to chow.

Armorer 
men were the last ones off the plane. They had to make 
sure everything was in working order for the planes 
takeoff when a mission was "Go!" Came the day when 
rumors were going around that the 379th was going to be 
deactivated. We were going to get a furlough to go home 
and then go to Japan, so it was said. Responding to a 
roll call not too long after rumors about the Triangle K 
Groups future started to circulate, my name was 
called. The next day I was told to report to an infantry 
division in England. Upon arriving, the infantrymen were 
calling me a glamour boy because they saw an 8th Air 
Force patch on my sleeve and my usual haircut. That 
changed quickly: I got a crew cut, a change of uniform 
and combat boots. I went through two weeks of infantry 
training and then got a 24 hour pass. I returned to 
Kimbolton to visit the boys. When they saw me in my 
infantry uniform, combat boots and crew cut, they could 
hardly believe it. They arranged a party and the next 
day we said our good-byes. The day following the return 
to my infantry unit, the U.S. Navy took me and my "new" 
buddies across the English Channel and we landed 
somewhere in France. I went through five major battles 
and stopped at the Siegfried line. A few days later I 
was transferred to the 989th Anti-aircraft outfit. With 
two and one half years overseas and the war over, I was 
sent home under the point system. I landed in Boston and 
was discharged from Fort Dix, New Jersey on November 7, 
1945.
