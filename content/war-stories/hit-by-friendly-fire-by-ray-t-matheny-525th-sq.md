HIT BY FRIENDLY FIRE by Ray T. Matheny 
(525th Sq.)

Our 
crew, Number 80, had only flown one mission up to that 
point to Knaben, Norway (Mission 42), and several 
training flights including the ill-conceived 
“Grapefruit” bombing trials of 2000-pound flying bombs. 
When the target was revealed on the map that morning 
showing our tracking to Bremen, an audible moan went up 
from the crews. We had heard that Bremen was a tough 
target because the shipping area was defended by 236, 
30-meter tall, concrete flak towers each mounting two 
88mm anti-aircraft guns These guns fired 21 rounds a 
minute from each barrel and the shell fuses were set by 
machine from radar input. Also, it was revealed 
that morning that the Germans had installed 
anti-aircraft guns on all rail cars creating a 20-mile 
radius of intense flak. Needless to say, the defense of 
Bremen was quite good with flak, but there were the 
fighters, too.

Our 
ship was named The Deacon’s Sinners after 
bombardier 2nd Lt. Melvin D. Henroid, who was the oldest 
man on the crew. The rest of us being much younger 
looked up to the “old man” who had a calming influence 
on us. Our crew that day consisted of: Thomas E. Eaton, 
pilot; Henry L. Hainline, co-pilot; Michael Roskovitch, 
navigator; Ray T. Matheny, engineer; Arnold G. Clark, 
radio; Ray Ferrell, ball turret; Arnold E. Nevells, 
right waist; Boleslaw B. Ceglarek, left waist; and 
Robert J. Lamoureaux, tail.

I 
believe that our altitude that day was 25,000’ over the 
target that required several hours of steady climb with 
our load of 250-lb bombs. We were promised Spitfire 
cover for a few minutes at sea near the Dutch coast, 
then a rendezvous with P-47s for 5-10 minutes to assist 
us from German fighters stationed at Lefuwarden guarding 
the south coast. The north approach was guarded with 
fighters at Jever, Nordholz and Oldenburg. There German 
staffeln could sit on the ground until radar tracking 
figured out our intentions, then strike the bombers on 
the way to the target and strike again on the way out, 
as refueling was nearby. We were told that several new 
Wurzburg radar antennae were noted on aerial photographs 
that would give the German fighter command a 150-mile 
warning of our approach. None of this news of the 
defense of Bremen cheered us.

As I 
remember, Henroid disliked the 250-lb British fire-type 
bombs we carried that day. He had some trouble with the 
fuses because they were in the tail of the bomb instead 
of the nose and arming wires had to be hooked up 
differently. And besides, it was reported that sometimes 
the tail fins came off altering the bomb’s trajectory. 
The crew talked about the use of these bombs and 
disliked dropping firebombs on a city where civilian 
populations lived. We still were new at this war and 
were filled with ideals of doing battle sol­dier to 
soldier, attacking military installations, and 
factories that produced war materials.

Intermittent notes from my account of the mission 
include a flight engineer’s concern about the flight. I 
later wrote: “The high power climb to 9,000 feet over 
England was costly in fuel, and assembly of the planes 
took fuel as well. Being The Deacons Sinners chief 
worrier, I thought about the fuel requirements of the 
flight but could do nothing about it. We were 
burning about 450 gallons of fuel per hour in the climb 
and just under 400 gph during assembly, now we were 
back to 430 gph for the long continued climb to Bremen . 
. . I counted 36 or 37 airplanes in a three-tiered 
formation where the lead echelon of 12 planes flew above 
the rear box of the lead formation. We flew in the lower 
echelon of 12 airplanes and would receive the worst 
flak. . . . We still were in a slow climb in loose 
formation when we had been airborne about 3 1/2 hours. 
We were at 22,000 feet over the north coast of Germany 
with a huge bay on our right.

No 
one had seen a Spitfire or P-47 since we had taken off 
and I supposed that the long climb through the overcast, 
and difficult assembly had cost us this valuable 
protection. After all, we expected the P-47s for only 
five minutes or so just inland of the German coast, and 
we missed them. Power went to full to bring us up to 
25,000’ in the next few miles. . . . ‘Bandits at 2 
o’clock,’ Nevells called. They were Me-109s, in 
several schwarmen of four planes each, about 3,000’ 
above us streaming contrails. Contrails suddenly 
appeared from behind our engines as the group climbed to 
colder conditions. Each ship produced its own clouds of 
condensed ice crystals behind it that grew as the 
ship climbed. That day at 25,000’ the contrails were 
heavy, stringy clouds that floated in the rarified air. 
The new clouds gave me a sense of security; a partial 
masking of our ship from a three-plane formation above 
us, but this feeling soon left as I saw Me-109s using 
the contrails to conceal their presence.

The 
fighter attack continued until Henroid called out a red 
burst of flak and immediately the fighters drew back, 
then disappeared. This was the signal from German 
anti-aircraft gunners to the attacking fighters just 
outside of Bremen that intensive flak was ahead. True to 
their signal the flak began with ugly black puffs in 
front of our group and in a trail the full length of the 
formation.

Flak 
was classified by flyers according to the danger it 
posed. The sight of black puffs, even at considerable 
distance, created a feeling of alarm, the closer to the 
flak bursts the greater the sense of alarm, which was 
expressed in ‘pucker factors’ on a scale of 1 to 10. 
Black puffs of flak 200 feet or more from your airplane 
always produced a 1 to 2 on the pucker factor scale, but 
it was rare the bursts at this distance could cause any 
harm. When the bursts of flak were closer, and a dull 
red flash could be seen at its center, the factor was 
over 5, maybe to 7, as there was real danger of shrapnel 
ripping through your airplane. The factor rose to an 8 
or 9 when you not only could see the dull red flash of 
the exploding shell, but could hear it go off 
over the roar of the engines and the slip stream noise 
on the airframe. At this point damage to the airplane 
was imminent. A pucker factor of 10 was when you were 
not flying through the black smoke of the exploding 
shells, but the red flash was bright, the sound 
deafening, and the force of the explosion lifted your 
plane up. This latter condition often meant destruction 
of the airplane and crew within the next few seconds.

Henroid called on the intercom that we were nearing the 
target and he had no sooner said it than bomb 
doors began opening on the airplanes in front of us. I 
heard a light slap-slap sound as pieces of exploding 
shell hit out airplane and spun around in the turret 
looking for damage. The flak was intense and it 
frightened me. The worst thing about it was there was 
nothing that could be done once the bomb run was under 
way on the autopilot. It was at this point that I began 
to feel the cold. My electrically heated underwear 
gloves and boots had failed and the cold was penetrating 
my body. My hand hurt and I slapped them together and 
flexed my fingers to increase the blood circulation. The 
outside air temperature was -47 degrees C, and it 
caused ice to form on the inside of my turret. The ice 
line grew from the top of the plexiglass ceiling down 
the sides of the turret. I watched it progress in a 
similar way in the cockpit. My vision was obscured in 
the turret but not enough to put me out of action. Ice 
formed at the bottom of my oxygen mask that had to be 
crushed and shaken out every half hour or so. The 
propeller pitch had to be changed every 15 minutes to 
circulate hot engine oil in the dome section. This was 
done to prevent the propeller from running away at high 
speed, becoming completely uncontrollable. If the 
propeller should run away, it would make the engine over 
speed, tear the rear reduction case off the engine with 
the propeller, or tear the engine from its mount, and in 
extreme cases, take the wing off....

The 
flak just about unnerved me. Finally, the lead ship 
dropped the bombs, and Henroid hit the sequency switch 
for our bomb release. As the flak continued, Henroid 
sang to us over the intercom which helped to relieve the 
tension. The lead ship went on full power to get us out 
of the line of fire, but the flak continued for such a 
long time. I heard a ‘crimp,’ ‘crump’ sound telling me 
the flak was very close. Then our ship was thrown upward 
and a large hole appeared in the right wing. It looked 
so strange to see green anti-corrosion painted metal on 
the under­side of the skin contrasting with the war 
paint on the surface. There was a sound of more flak 
bursts and more holes appeared. A green burst of flak 
appeared, and fighters suddenly resumed their attack. 
This time I saw a Junkers 88 and two Messerschmitt 210s 
or 410s, but they flew beside us out of .50 calibre 
range. Lamoureaux called out that a fighter had lost a 
wing, probably shot down by a lower echelon gunner. 
There was a long trail of black smoke in front of our 
group that must have come from a bomber. Henroid called 
out two Me-109s at 12 o’clock just a little high I swung 
the turret around in time to see his guns thumping, too 
late to get in a shot. Henroid called on the interphone 
saying in a calm voice that he was hit, and that the 
navigator was taking care of him. With all that was 
going on I was not surprised that someone had been 
wounded, but the news made me cringe. . . . Despite his 
wound, Henroid seemed to be making it alright, he sat up 
against the control boxes at his station. The navigator 
had stopped the bleeding with a large gauze pad and 
bound his wound. I could offer Henroid no help, and 
waved to him from the crawl way; he good-spiritedly 
waved back. We left the German coast, passed the Frisian 
Islands, dropping down to 20,000 feet, slowly descending 
over the North Sea.

Soon 
the coast of England came into view and Eaton exclaimed, 
‘Thank God the overcast is broken,’ he was beginning to 
show signs of fatigue, and tore off his helmet handing 
it to me. . . We approached Kimbolton airfield 
with a ship in front of us that was firing red flares 
into the air indicating wounded on board... . I fired a 
red flare through a Verry pistol mount in the top of the 
cockpit, then Eaton slipped in behind the other ship. I 
suppose that everyone was getting nervous at this time 
as fuel was quite low. What a relief to get down on the 
ground, and how good it felt to jump out of the ship and 
feel the earth beneath my feet. This flight had taken 
six hours.

Henroid 
had been hit in the right knee taking off the patella. 
The pain was intense, but he carefully took off his 
helmet and goggles, and put on his army cap before 
allowing the medics to 
carry him out. Our ship had 53 good-sized flak holes in 
it, mostly in the right wing. Hainline stuck his hand 
through one hole torn through the wing behind the fuel 
cell. The right wing had to be replaced keeping our 
plane on the ground for several days. I traced the path 
of the bullet that struck Henroid from the nose section 
through the fuselage. I found the copper jacket of the 
armor-piercing bullet in the crawl way under the control 
quadrant of the cockpit. The copper piece had black 
paint on the tip, and unmistakably, it was a .50 calibre 
bullet from one of our own planes. I put the copper 
bullet jacket in my pocket, and did not tell Henroid 
that he had been wounded by a wild shot from another 
B-17.

Several years after the war, I visited Henroid and his 
family and finally told him about the .50 calibre bullet.
