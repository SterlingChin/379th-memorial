The 379TH BOMB GROUP WWII ASSOCIATION Heritage Monument was dedicated September 20 1997 at THE MIGHTY EIGHTH AIR FORCE HERITAGE MUSEUM MEMORIAL GARDENS in Savannah, Georgia. This monument tells where the 379th Bomb Group was during WWII, proudly displays what was accomplished while there, and preserves its outstanding history for present and future generations to read to reminisce and to admire. The monument is made of the hardest stone in the world, a highly polished jet-black granite imported from India. It is eight feet high, four feet wide, weighs 7081 pounds and is set on a 2400-pound subterranean concrete base. Monument Highlights: 

Triangle K on the top 

Two B-17s etched into each of the two faces of the Monument 

Two flush-mounted bronze replicas positioned in the left and right shoulders with the 8th Air Force and the 379th Bomb Group emblems 

The Group combat history 

The 72 military occupations of 6000 personnel that served at Kimbolton 

Through the cooperation of British Airways and the United States Department of Agriculture, three pounds of soil from the old Kimbolton airbase were blended with soil in front of the Heritage Monument. The soil had been gathered from both ends of the three runways, from the area around the control tower, from in front of the 379th Monument at the entrance to the old airbase, from the lawn of St. Andrew's Church in Kimbolton, and from the lawn of the ancient castle at the other end of the village. In a fitting prelude to the 
monument's unveiling, Mrs. Peggy Convine of Kimbolton, 
England, the owner of the family farm on which the 
Triangle K airbase was located, participated with 
General Lewis Lyle in distributing the soil around the 
base of the monument.

Association as an active member and advisor to the Board 
of Directors. The wall plaque is located in the 
Memorial Gardens on the wall directly behind the 379th 
Bomb Group WWII Association monument at the Mighty

In 2009, the 379th Association’s memorial was 
installed in the Mighty 8th AF Museum Chapel 
of the Fallen Eagles in Pooler, GA. Jon Erickson, the 
artist and designer, captured the project committee’s 
suggestions for the design and the result is most 
impressive. The colors in the glass are vibrant with the 
379th insignia and all squadron patches 
included, as well as a ribbon with “379th BG” 
and both versions of the Triangle K. Our top ‘Century 
Club’ B-17, “Topper/Ol’ Gappy”, is recognized for its 
157 mission record. Father Sullivan, who was most always 
at the runway during take-offs, provides his blessing to 
a representative aircrew. 

This 
is lasting tribute to all who served in the 379th 
Bombardment Group (H) during WWII.
